# Cryptocurrency Market Analysis: A Fear & Greed Index Study

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the cryptocurrency market, focusing on the relationship between historical price data and the **Fear & Greed Index**. The project includes a detailed Jupyter Notebook with data visualizations and a dynamic Power BI dashboard to showcase key insights.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to explore and visualize the sentiment of the crypto market using two key datasets:

1.  **Fear & Greed Index Data**: A sentiment metric that measures the emotional state of crypto investors.
2.  **Historical Crypto Price Data**: Historical price and volume data for major cryptocurrencies.

By combining these datasets, the analysis aims to uncover potential correlations and patterns that could help in understanding market trends and investor behavior.

## Repository Structure

The project is structured into clear and logical folders to make it easy to navigate and understand the workflow.

* `data/`: Contains the raw and processed datasets used for the analysis.
* `notebooks/`: Houses the Jupyter Notebook (`crypto_market_analysis.ipynb`) with the full data cleaning, analysis, and visualization code.
* `visualizations/`: Stores the Power BI dashboard file (`crypto_market_analysis.pbix`) and preview images.

## Key Insights and Visualizations

The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step analysis with visualizations. Some of the key findings include:

* **Correlation between Market Sentiment and Price Action**: Visualizations showing how extreme fear and greed levels often precede significant market movements.
* **Historical Trends**: Charts illustrating the long-term relationship between the Fear & Greed Index and the price of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
* **Volume and Volatility Analysis**: Insights into how trading volume and volatility fluctuate in relation to market sentiment.

### Power BI Dashboard

For a more interactive experience, a Power BI dashboard was created to summarize the key findings. The dashboard allows users to filter and explore the data, providing a dynamic view of market sentiment and historical performance.

## Tools and Technologies

* **Jupyter Notebook**: For data analysis and visualization.
* **Python**: The core programming language.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For creating static data visualizations.
* **Power BI Desktop**: For creating the interactive dashboard.
