# 🚗 Car Dashboard - Power BI Project
This repository contains an interactive Car Dashboard built using Power BI, designed to analyze and visualize key metrics from a dataset containing details about used cars.

Year – Year of manufacture
Kilometers_Driven – Distance the car has been driven
Fuel_Type – Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.)
Transmission – Manual or Automatic
Mileage – Mileage offered by the car (in km/l)
Engine – Engine capacity in CC
Power – Engine power in bhp
Seats – Number of seats in the car
Price – Selling price of the car (in INR lakhs)

# 📌 Key Features
